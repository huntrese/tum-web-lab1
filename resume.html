                    <pre>
                        Developed an algorithmto optimize restaurant delivery routes, achieving a 38 percent reduction in delivery times, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and increased efficiency.
                        used python(FastAPI + css)

                        Developed a sophisticated bot capable of playing online games seamlessly, leveraging a finely-tuned YOLO model to recognize game elements. By identifying buttons and implementing logic for mimicking human behavior, the bot remained undetected, enhancing its performance and longevity      
                        Used Python (Dataset with Roboflow, detection with Pytorch)
