                    <pre>
                        I successfully developed a website illustrating an E-book Library, by leveraging advanced Laravel knowledge and deployment skills, resulting in an engaging platform where users can read books.
                        Used Laravel + Vue + MySQL.

                    <pre>
                        Developed an algorithm to optimize restaurant delivery routes, achieving a 38% reduction in delivery times, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and increased efficiency.
                        Used Python (FastAPI + CSS).

                    <h4><a href="#">Game Bot</a></h4>
                    <pre>
                        Developed a sophisticated bot capable of playing online games seamlessly, leveraging a finely-tuned YOLO model to recognize game elements. By identifying buttons and implementing logic for mimicking human behavior, the bot remained undetected, enhancing its performance and longevity.      
                        Used Python (Dataset with Roboflow, detection with PyTorch).
